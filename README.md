## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Media queries for layout switching (mobile to desktop)
- Organizing BEM-style class names for better scalability
- Creating accessible HTML with `aria-labelledby`

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Get more confident using CSS Grid for complex layouts
- Explore accessibility features further (like `aria-*`, focus styles, semantic tags)
- Try utility-first CSS libraries like Tailwind for rapid prototyping

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Great for CSS and accessibility references.
- [CSS Tricks â€“ Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A lifesaver when working with Flexbox layouts.
- [Frontend Mentor Slack Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) - Helpful feedback and motivation.
